This is a puzzle solver for the game Call of Duty: World War 2, map Frozen Dawn rod game puzzle. The puzzle consists of a rod made up of 4 parts. 
Each part has a face that shows which direction it is facing. The rod spawns with each facing a random direction 
and the purpose is to make all of the parts face towards the front. Each time a section of the rod is shot or hit it rotates the hit section twice or by 180 degrees.
It also rotates the sections both below and on top once or by 90 degrees. 

Run window_test.py to begin. A window will appear displaying arrows. Clicking each arrow will rotate it by 90 degrees. 
Make the arrows match with the arrows in-game and click submit.

After clicking submit the console will display how many times each arrow needs to be hit in-game to rotate all arrows back to facing towards the character.
